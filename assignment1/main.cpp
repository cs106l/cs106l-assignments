 * 1) Take a look at the split function we provide in utils.cpp

 * 3) The first line in the CSV defines the column names, so you can ignore it!

 * IMPORTANT: do this after you write out to the file!
 *
 * HINTS:
 * 1) Keep track of the classes that you need to delete!
 * 2) Use the delete_elem_from_vector function we give you!
 * 3) Remember to write the CSV column headers at the beginning of the output!
 *    See courses.csv for reference.

 *                    This vector will be modified by removing all offered courses.
